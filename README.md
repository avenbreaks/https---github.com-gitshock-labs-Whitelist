## Inspiration
Inspiration for this came from many different projects. Some notable ones include:
- [Scaffold-eth buyer-mints](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/buyer-mints-nft) - a more complex version of this project :) I learned a ton from this example!
- Anish Agnihotri's [ERC20 merkle airdrop scaffold](https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/merkle-airdrop-starter) - focused on ERC20 airdrops but similar Merkle Tree validation logic
- Medium article on [Using Merkle Trees for NFT Whitelists](https://medium.com/@ItsCuzzo/using-merkle-trees-for-nft-whitelists-523b58ada3f9) by Alan, super helpful article to better understand Merkle Trees
- https://www.721.so/ - haven't personally tested it, but looks like another awesome resource
- Most of the front-end web3 tooling is built on top of [`web3-react`](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react) - check out this library if you're building your own web3 UIs
- Lots of inspiration taken from the [Crypto Coven contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5180db8f5c931aae63c74266b211f580155ecac8#contracts) as well - they used Merkle Trees for their community and gift mints
